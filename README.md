# Basic Stopwatch

## Overview

In this project, you will create a basic stopwatch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This stopwatch will have the following features:

- **Start/Stop Button:** Toggle the stopwatch on and off.
- **Reset Button:** Reset the time to zero.
- **Time Display:** Show elapsed time in hours, minutes, and seconds.

This project will test your knowledge in:

- Structuring a web page with HTML.
- Styling elements with CSS.
- Adding interactivity with JavaScript.

By the end, you'll have a functional stopwatch and a better understanding of how these technologies work together. Let's get started!
